# NCRLS algorithm with CG and preconditioning
The code is written for the numerical experiments of the paper "Iterative Approach for Coefficient-based Functional Linear Regression with Covariate Shift". The algorithm here is the Nystrom coefficient-based regularized least squares with conjugate gradient method (CG) and preconditioning.
